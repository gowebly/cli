### `init`

Command to create a **default** config file ([`.gowebly.yml`][repo_default_config]) in the current folder.

```console
gowebly init
```

> 💡 Note: Of course, you can skip this step if you're comfortable with the following default configuration for your new project:
>
> - Go module (`go.mod`) and `package.json` names are set to **project**;
> - Without any Go framework for the backend part (only built-in **net/http** package);
> - Without any CSS framework for the frontend part (only default styles for the code example);
> - The JavaScript runtime environment for the frontend part is set to **Node.js**;
> - Server port is `5000`, timeout (in seconds): `5` for read, `10` for write;
> - Latest versions of the **htmx** & **hyperscript**.

<img width="720" alt="gowebly init" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gowebly/.github/main/images/gowebly_init.png">

Typically, a created config file contains the following options:

```yaml
backend:
   module_name: project # (string) option can be any name of your Go module (for example, 'github.com/user/project')
   go_framework: default # (string) option can be one of the values: 'fiber', 'echo', 'chi', or 'default'
   port: 5000 # (int) option can be any port that is not taken up on your system
   timeout:
      read: 5 # (int) option can be any number of seconds, 5 is recommended
      write: 10 # (int) option can be any number of seconds, 10 is recommended

frontend:
   package_name: project # (string) option can be any name of your package.json (for example, 'project')
   css_framework: default # (string) option can be one of the values: 'tailwindcss', 'unocss', or 'default'
   runtime_environment: default # (string) option can be one of the values: 'bun', or 'default'
   htmx: latest # (string) option can be any existing version
   hyperscript: latest # (string) option can be any existing version
```

But, you can choose any **Go framework** for your project's backend:

| Go framework | Description                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`    | Don't use any Go framework (only built-in [net/http][net_http_url] package) |
| `fiber`      | Use a Go backend with the [Fiber][fiber_url] web framework                  |
| `echo`       | Use a Go backend with the [Echo][echo_url] web framework                    |
| `chi`        | Use a Go backend with the [chi][chi_url] composable router                  |

In additional, you can choose versions of the **htmx**, **hyperscript**, and
one of the most popular atomic/utility-first **CSS framework** to your
project:

| CSS framework | Description                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`     | Don't use any CSS framework (only default styles for the code example) |
| `tailwindcss` | Use the [Tailwind CSS][tailwindcss_url] as a CSS framework             |
| `unocss`      | Use the [UnoCSS][unocss_url] as a CSS framework                        |

Also, you can set one of the JavaScript runtime environment for your
frontend part:

| JavaScript runtime | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`          | Use the [Node.js][nodejs_url] as a JavaScript runtime environment |
| `bun`              | Use the [Bun][bun_url] as a JavaScript runtime environment        |

### `create`

Command to create a new project with the **Go** backend, **htmx** & **hyperscript**, and (_optionally_) atomic/utility-first **CSS framework**.

```console
gowebly create
```

> 💡 Note: If you don't run `init` command to create a config file (`.gowebly.yml`), the `gowebly` CLI creates a new project with a [default][repo_default_config] configuration.

<img width="720" alt="gowebly create" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gowebly/.github/main/images/gowebly_create.png">

Every time you make `create` command for your project:

1. CLI validates the config and applies all settings to the current project;
2. CLI prepares the backend part of your project (generates the project structure and needed utility files, runs `go mod tidy`);
3. CLI prepares the frontend part of your project (generates the needed utility files, runs `npm|bun install` and `npm|bun run build:dev` for the first time);
4. CLI downloads minimized versions of **htmx** and **hyperscript** (from official and trusted [unpkg.com][unpkg_url] CDN) to the `./static` folder and places them as separated `<script>` tags (at the bottom of the `<body>` tag) in the Go HTML template [`templates/main.html`][repo_main_layout].

Typically, a created project contains the following files and folders:

```console
.
├── assets
│   └── styles.css
├── static
│   ├── favicons
│   │   ├── apple-touch-icon.png
│   │   ├── favicon.ico
│   │   ├── favicon.png
│   │   ├── favicon.svg
│   │   ├── manifest-screenshot-desktop.jpeg
│   │   ├── manifest-mobile-desktop.jpeg
│   │   └── manifest-touch-icon.svg
│   ├── images
│   │   └── logo.svg
│   ├── htmx.min.js
│   ├── hyperscript.min.js
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── manifest.json
├── templates
│   ├── pages
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── main.html
├── .gitignore
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── handlers.go
├── main.go
├── package.json
└── server.go
```

### `run`

Command to run your project in a **development** (non-production) mode.

```console
gowebly run
```

> 💡 Note: If you don't run `init` command to create a config file (`.gowebly.yml`), the `gowebly` CLI runs your project with a [default][repo_default_config] configuration.

<img width="720" alt="gowebly run" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gowebly/.github/main/images/gowebly_run.png">

Every time you make `run` command for your project:

1. CLI validates the config and applies all settings to the current project;
2. CLI prepares the frontend part of your project (runs `npm|bun run watch`);
3. CLI prepares a development (non-production) version of the selected **CSS framework** to the `./static` folder and places it as a `<link>` tag (at the bottom of the `<head>` tag) in the Go HTML template [`templates/main.html`][repo_main_layout];
4. CLI starts a project's backend with settings from the default configuration (or from the `.gowebly.yml` config file) by a simple `go run` command.

### `build`

Command to build your project for **production** and prepare Docker files for deploy.

```console
gowebly build [OPTION]
```

> 💡 Note: If you don't run `init` command to create a config file (`.gowebly.yml`), the `gowebly` CLI builds your project with a [default][repo_default_config] configuration.

<img width="720" alt="gowebly build" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gowebly/.github/main/images/gowebly_build.png">

You might add the following options:

| Option          | Description                                                                    | Required? |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `--skip-docker` | Skip generation process for the Docker files (it's helpful if you've your own) | no        |

Every time you make `build` command for your project:

1. CLI validates the config and applies all settings to the current project;
2. CLI downloads minimized versions of **htmx** and **hyperscript** (from official and trusted [unpkg.com][unpkg_url] CDN) to the `./static` folder and places them as separated `<script>` tags (at the bottom of the `<body>` tag) in the Go HTML template [`templates/main.html`][repo_main_layout];
3. CLI prepares a production version of the selected **CSS framework** and places it as a `<link>` tag (at the bottom of the `<head>` tag) in the Go HTML template [`templates/main.html`][repo_main_layout];
4. If the `--skip-docker` option is not set, CLI generate a clear and well-documented Docker files (`.dockerignore`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) in the root of the project folder to deploy it in isolated containers via [Portainer][portainer_url] (_recommended_), or manually, to your remote server.

### `doctor`

Command to show helpful **information** about your system.

```console
gowebly doctor
```

> 💡 Note: This is very useful for the self-debugging process, or creating a new [issue][repo_issues_url] with a bug report in this GitHub repository.

<img width="720" alt="gowebly doctor" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gowebly/.github/main/images/gowebly_doctor.png">

Every time you make `doctor` command for your system:

1. CLI checks the versions of all the required tools to make your project successful (such as `gowebly` CLI, Go, Node.js, Docker, Docker Compose, etc.);
2. CLI produces a report with the installed version for each tool.

## 🙋 User-friendly helpers

The `gowebly` CLI has a library of user-friendly [helpers][gowebly_helpers_url] for your code. This will help you start building beautiful web applications in Go even faster.

```console
go get -u github.com/gowebly/helpers
```

> 💡 Note: The `gowebly helpers` library is **already** included in the Go backend that is created by the `create` command, but you can use these helpers in other projects as well.

## 🎯 Motivation to create

Tell us, how often have you had to start a new project from scratch and had to make painful manual configurations? 🤔 Especially, when you are just getting acquainted with a new technology or stack, where everything is new to you.

For many developers, _including us_, this process is as tedious and even depressing as possible, and doesn't carry any useful workload. It is a **very** frustrating process that can push any developer away from technology a lot.

Why not just give all that awful manual work to machines? Let them do all the hard work for us, and we will just create awesome web products and not have to think about build and deploy.

That's why we created the `gowebly` CLI and its helpers' library, which helps you start an amazing web applications in **Go** using **htmx**, **hyperscript** and popular atomic/utility-first **CSS frameworks**.

We are here to save you (_and ourselves_) from this routine pain! ✨

> 💬 From the authors: Earlier, we have already saved the world once, it was [Create Go App][cgapp_url] (yep, that's our project too). The [GitHub stars][cgapp_stars_url] statistics of this project can't lie: more than **2.2k** developers of any level and different countries start a new project through this CLI tool.
